<h1 style="text-align: center;">DOTA 2 </h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dota 2 is one of the biggest titles in all of esports. With an enormous player base that spans the entire world, the most lucrative professional scene and the most grandiose tournament in the entire industry, the Valve-made MOBA stands as alongside any other juggernaut in competitive gaming.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>HISTORY</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of Defense of the Ancients, was hired by Valve to create a modernized remake for them in the Source game engine. ... Dota 2 has a large esports scene, with teams from around the world playing in various professional leagues and tournaments.</p>
 
<h2 style="text-align: center;">THE INTERNATIONAL</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The International, often abbreviated as TI, is an annual tournament organized by Valve. In 2015 Valve increased their number of hosted events, founding the Dota Major Championships which incorporates The International into its structure. The International remains the biggest and most prestigious event on the Major Championship circuit.</p>

    <h3>TOP 10 TEAMS </h3>

        <ul>
            <ol type="1">
            <li style="color: rgb(83, 83, 83);"><b> Evil Genuises </b></li>
            <p>EG is one of the oldest teams in North America, created in late 2011, and has remained one of the best Dota 2 teams to this day.
                According to the latest Dota Pro Circuit rankings, EG holds the number one spot with an impressive score of 1700 dpc points. PSG.LGD follows close behind with 1300 dps points, which indicates just how far ahead Evil Geniuses have gone in the recent 2021 DPC season.
                On top of that, the most recent ESL world rankings place Evil Geniuses in second place, some 500-ish points shy from number one where PSG.LGD currently resides.
                The EG squad is in top shape and they’re one of the main contenders for this year’s The International 10 title.</p>
             <li style="color: blue;"><b>PSG.LGD</b></li>
            <p>As mentioned previously, PSG.LGD is constantly switching places with EG for that number one spot as the best Dota 2 team. This Chinese esports giant has been on fire during the 2021 DPC season, achieving great results and securing the spot at the upcoming The International 10
                The closest they came to winning The International was in 2018 when they lost to OG in the Grand Final. They’ve worked hard and have prepared well, so we’ll see whether luck will serve them this time around.</p>
            <li style="color: red;"><b>T1</b></li>
            <p>ormerly known as SK Telecom T1, this esports organisation formed their Dota 2 team in 2019 with Forev as their first member. Over the past several years, they’ve solidified their core roster and become one of the best Dota 2 teams in the entire world
                Despite being a relatively young squad, at least compared to some veteran teams who’ve been around since the early days of Dota 2, T1 has managed to accomplish much in this short period. They’re the number three team according to the ESL world ranking and have climbed to number six in the latest DPC season with 1070 dpc points.
                Overall, T1 is one of the most promising Dota 2 teams in 2021 and they’ve got the potential to claim this year’s Aegis of Champions</p>
            <li><b>Team Secret</b></li>
            <p>Dota 2 fans still remember the golden days of 2014 when Team Secret’s roster consisted of some legendary names such as Puppey, KuroKy, s4, and N0tail. These are some of the best Dota 2 players today, and while they’re not playing in the same roster, they do have their own teams they’re leading.

                Puppey is the only one who remained in Team Secret and has successfully managed to lead this team to many victories. Despite all of that, The International still eludes them and they’re hoping that will change this year at the TI1</p>
            <li style="color: rgb(96, 153, 190);"><b>OG</b></li>
            <p>OG find themselves in the middle of our list as they’re currently sitting in a strange spot. On one hand, they’re the legendary back-to-back The International winners ( TI 2018 and TI 2019 ) and are one of the highest-earning Dota 2 teams. On the other hand, they have been fairly inactive in the Dota 2 scene since 2019 when they won The International 2019.

                However, they are back once again and have even managed to qualify for The International 10, suggesting they’ll be attempting to claim the Aegis for the third time in a row. Things have changed quite a bit in Dota 2 during the past few years so they’ll have to prepare for a tough fight.
                
                They have a scary roster with SumaiL, Topson, Ceb, N0tail, and Saksa. They’ve been away for a long time and many have written them off, but this squad should by no means be underestimated as they can easily turn that into their advantage and take TI10 by storm.</p>
            <li style="color: rgb(83, 81, 77);"><b>Invictus Gaming</b></li>
            <p>The TI 2012 champions have had a great 2021 season. Being one of the best teams in China, and the world, they are always hovering at the top of the rankings. They hold the number five spot in the DPC 2021 and ESL world ranking, making them one of the best Dota 2 teams in 2021.

                Chinese Dota has been really strong and that’s evident by the sheer number of Chinese teams attending this year’s TI 10. We have Invictus Gaming, Vici Gaming, Team Aster, and even Elephant. Invictus Gaming is leading the charge but the others are following close behind.</p>
            <li style="color: orange;"><b>Virtus.pro</b></li>
            <p>This wouldn’t be a proper list without mentioning the Russian powerhouse – Virtus.pro.
                These guys have been very active in the 2021 DPC season, achieving 1200 dpc points and securing third place in the list. The ESL rankings are slightly different, and they find themselves holding onto the 10th spot there.
                
                All in all, they’ve been very successful in 2021 and have demonstrated that they’re one of the best Dota 2 teams in the world today.</p>
            <li style="color: rgb(59, 97, 49);"><b>Alliance</b></li>
            <p>Alliance are the The International 2013 champions and they have close to a decade worth of experience in Dota 2. They are one of the most consistent Dota 2 teams who have been around from the very beginning and have never fallen off.
                The Alliance squad is led by s4, who is one of the Dota 2 veterans and has a vast knowledge about the game and its high-tier tournaments. Nikobaby and fng are there as well, making this a very well-rounded roster. They are perfectly capable of taking The International 10. They’ve done it once and they can do it again.</p>
            <li style="color: rgb(112, 48, 214);"><b>Team Nigma</b></li>
            <p>KuroKy’s squad is one of the best Dota 2 teams in Europe. Although they haven’t managed to qualify for The International 10 and will sadly be missing all the action this year, they are still one of the best Dota 2 teams in 2021.
                When hearing the names such as Miracle-, KuroKy, MinD_ContRoL, and GH, you can’t help but to stand in awe. These are some incredible players and they form an insanely strong squad together.</p>
            <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>Vici Gaming</b></li>
            <p>We’re ending the list with Vici Gaming. They are one of the best Dota 2 teams in the world and one of the oldest teams in Dota 2 esports.
                They’ve been around since 2012, competing at major Dota 2 esports tournaments, including The International 2014 where they finished second after losing to Newbee in the Grand Final. The Aegis was within their grasp, but it just wasn’t meant to be.  
                The team has done really well on the ESL world ranking in 2021 where they currently hold the 4th spot, and the results in DPC are not too shabby either, where they sit on a comfy 7th spot with 950 points.</p>
